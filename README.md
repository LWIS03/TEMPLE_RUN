## Game Description

*Temple Run* is an endless runner video game originally released in 2011 by Imangi Studios. This project adapts the experience for computers, adding unique features and custom elements.

### Key Features:
- **Target Audience**: Broad, including teenagers and young adults.  
- **Notable Highlights**: Procedural map generation, character movement (jump, slide, turn), and a scoring system based on time and coins.  
- **Inspiration**: Classic elements of *Temple Run* combined with custom sounds, animations, and particles for enhanced interactivity.

## Implemented Features

### Character:
- **Basic Movements**: Jump, slide, move laterally, and turn.  
- **Visual and Sound Effects**: Sounds synchronized with actions and particle effects.  

### Map:
- Procedurally generated with:  
  - Straights, turns, splits, cliffs, and obstacles.  
  - Interaction with dynamic elements like trees and flamethrowers.  

### Enemies:
- Appear when the player collides with specific obstacles and chase the character until another object is dodged.

### Other Features:
- Scoring system based on distance covered and collected coins.  
- **God Mode**: Automatically dodges obstacles and turns.

## Methodology

The project was developed using **Trello** to manage tasks and collaboration among team members. Due to technical issues, the development was centralized on one computer for the base implementation.  

---

## Conclusions

- **Achievements**: A functional game with aesthetics and gameplay similar to the original.  
- **Improvements Needed**: Code optimization and enhancement of *God Mode* to include automatic coin collection.
